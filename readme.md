import {VFile} from 'vfile'
import {reporterPretty} from 'vfile-reporter-pretty'

const file = new VFile({path: '~/example.md'})

file.message('`braavo` is misspelt; did you mean `bravo`?', {line: 1, column: 8})
file.info('This is perfect', {line: 2, column: 1})

try {
  file.fail('This is horrible', {line: 3, column: 5})
} catch (error) {}

console.log(reporterPretty([file]))
```
